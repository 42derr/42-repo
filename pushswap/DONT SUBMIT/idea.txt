Reduce the Number of Rotations:

Avoid unnecessary rotations by grouping elements that need to stay together.
Use rotation counters and only perform the rotations when necessary.
Batch Operations:

Instead of moving elements one by one, try to identify groups of elements that can be moved together in fewer operations.
Track Elements' Final Position:

Use additional data structures to keep track of where elements need to be moved, reducing the need for multiple passes over the data.
