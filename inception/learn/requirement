🛠️ Docker & Infrastructure Setup

    🐳 All Docker images must match their service names.

    🧱 Each service runs in its own container.

    🏗️ Build containers using penultimate stable version of Alpine or Debian (no latest).

    📄 Write your own Dockerfile per service.

    🧰 Use docker-compose.yml via Makefile to build everything.

    🚫 Do not pull prebuilt images from Docker Hub — build yourself.

📦 Service Requirements

    🌐 NGINX container with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only, must be the only entry point (port 443).

    📝 WordPress container with php-fpm only, no NGINX.

    🛢️ MariaDB container, no NGINX.

    💾 Use a volume for WordPress database.

    📁 Use a second volume for WordPress site files.

    🌐 Set up a custom Docker network connecting all services.

    🔄 Containers must restart automatically on crash.

📚 Best Practices

    ⚠️ Avoid using tail -f or similar hacks to keep containers alive — learn how daemons and PID 1 work in Docker.

    📖 Read about PID 1 behavior and Dockerfile best practices.

🔐 Security & Environment

    👥 In your WordPress DB, create two users, including an admin, but admin username must NOT contain "admin"/"administrator" in any form.

    🔐 Use environment variables instead of hardcoding passwords.

    📁 Use a .env file for environment configs.

    🕵️‍♂️ Use Docker secrets for sensitive data (like DB passwords).

    🏷️ Do NOT use the latest tag for base images.

🌍 Domain & DNS

    🧭 Set your domain name to point to your local IP.

    🔗 Must use a domain like yourlogin.42.fr (e.g., wil.42.fr if your login is wil).

    🌐 NGINX is the only externally accessible container, served over HTTPS (443).
